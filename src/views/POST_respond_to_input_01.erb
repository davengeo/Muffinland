<h1>Welcome to Muffinland. So here's what you get to do:</h1>

<ol>
  <li> Create new content by using the URL /post.
    It will let you enter some content into a text field;
    and will tell you what page that went into. </li>
  <li> Look at old content by using the URL /0 or /1
    or /(whatever the page number is you want to see).
    It will show you the content of that page.  </li>
</ol>
<p> That is all that is working just now. </p>

<p> Page requested was "<%= path %>", with parameters <%= params %></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<p>Best Wishes, Alistair</p>
